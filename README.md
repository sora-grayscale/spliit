**anon-spliit** is a privacy-focused fork of [Spliit](https://github.com/spliit-app/spliit). All user data is **end-to-end encrypted (E2EE)** - the server stores only encrypted blobs and never sees your actual data.

## Why anon-spliit?

- **True Privacy**: Your expense data is encrypted before it leaves your browser
- **Zero-Knowledge**: The server cannot read your group names, participants, or amounts
- **No Accounts**: Share groups via encrypted links - no sign-up required
- **Open Source**: Fully transparent, self-hostable, and auditable

## Privacy Features

| Feature                   | Description                                              |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **E2E Encryption**        | AES-128-GCM encryption with keys stored in URL fragments |
| **Zero-Knowledge Server** | Server only stores encrypted data                        |
| **Password Protection**   | Optional PBKDF2-based password for additional security   |
| **No Tracking**           | No analytics, no cookies, no fingerprinting              |

## What's Encrypted

**All sensitive user data is encrypted client-side before being sent to the server.**

| Data                | Encrypted |
| ------------------- | :-------: |
| Group name          |    ✅     |
| Group description   |    ✅     |
| Group currency      |    ✅     |
| Group currency code |    ✅     |
| Participant names   |    ✅     |
| Expense titles      |    ✅     |
| Expense notes       |    ✅     |
| Expense amounts     |    ✅     |
| Expense category    |    ✅     |
| Original currency   |    ✅     |
| Split shares        |    ✅     |
| Activity log data   |    ✅     |

**The server cannot decrypt any of this data** - encryption keys exist only in the URL fragment (never sent to the server) and optionally in your browser's localStorage.

## Features

- Split expenses evenly or by custom amounts/percentages/shares
- Track balances and get optimized reimbursement suggestions
- Support for multiple currencies with exchange rates
- Attach receipts and documents to expenses
- Export data to JSON/CSV
- Progressive Web App (PWA) - install on mobile
- Dark mode support
- Multi-language (English, Japanese, and more)
- **Private Instance Mode** - Restrict access to whitelisted users

## Quick Start

### Deploy Your Own Instance

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsora-grayscale%2Fspliit&project-name=my-anon-spliit&repository-name=my-anon-spliit&stores=%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22postgres%22%7D%5D)

### Run Locally

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sora-grayscale/spliit.git
cd spliit

# Start PostgreSQL
./scripts/start-local-db.sh

# Setup environment
cp .env.example .env

# Install and run
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

### Run with Docker

```bash
pnpm run build-image
cp container.env.example container.env
pnpm run start-container
```

## Private Instance Mode

For self-hosted deployments, you can restrict access to whitelisted users only.

### Setup

```bash
# Enable private instance mode
PRIVATE_INSTANCE=true

# Initial admin credentials
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password

# NextAuth.js configuration
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

### Features

- **Admin Dashboard** - Manage whitelisted users at `/admin`
- **Initial Password** - Users receive a generated password that must be changed on first login
- **Password Reset** - Admins can reset user passwords
- **Shared Group Access** - Shared links still work without authentication (protected by encryption key)
- **Group Creation** - Only whitelisted users can create new groups

## Tech Stack

| Category   | Technology                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Frontend   | Next.js 16, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS |
| Backend    | tRPC, Prisma ORM                           |
| Database   | PostgreSQL                                 |
| Encryption | Web Crypto API (AES-128-GCM, HKDF, PBKDF2) |
| UI         | shadcn/ui                                  |

## Security

### How Encryption Works

1. **Key Generation**: A random 128-bit key is generated when creating a group
2. **Key Storage**: The key is stored in the URL fragment (`#key`) - this part is never sent to the server
3. **Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted client-side using AES-128-GCM
4. **Password Protection**: Optionally add a password using PBKDF2 (100,000 iterations)

### Best Practices

- Share group links only with trusted people
- Use password protection for sensitive financial data
- Don't share URLs in screenshots (they contain your encryption key)
- Self-host for maximum privacy
