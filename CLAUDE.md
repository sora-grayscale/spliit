# anon-spliit - Development Guide

> Anonymous bill splitting with end-to-end encryption

## Project Overview

**anon-spliit** is a privacy-focused fork of [Spliit](https://github.com/spliit-app/spliit). All user data is **end-to-end encrypted (E2EE)** - the server never sees unencrypted data. The encryption key is stored in the URL fragment and never sent to the server.

**Repository**: https://github.com/sora-grayscale/spliit
**Twitter/X**: [@sora_grayscale](https://x.com/sora_grayscale)

## Architecture

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 16 (App Router), React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: tRPC, Prisma ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Encryption**: Web Crypto API (AES-128-GCM, HKDF SHA-256)
- **Deployment**: Vercel, Docker/Podman

### E2EE Design Philosophy

- **Zero-knowledge server**: The server never sees unencrypted data
- **URL fragment key storage**: Encryption key in `#<base64key>` format (never sent to server)
- **localStorage persistence**: Keys saved per-group for convenience
- **Everything encrypted**: Group names, participant names, expense titles, notes, amounts, categories

## Development Rules

### 1. Version Control with jj (Jujutsu)

- Use `jj` instead of `git` for version control
- Leverage parallel development with multiple changes
- Common commands:
  ```bash
  jj status                    # Check status
  jj log                       # View history
  jj new                       # Create new change
  jj describe -m "message"     # Set commit message
  jj git push --change @       # Push current change
  ```

### 2. Branch/PR Strategy

- **1 feature = 1 branch = 1 PR**
- Keep PRs small and focused
- Use descriptive branch names: `feature/password-protection`, `feature/amount-encryption`
- Always base new features on `main`

### 3. Testing Requirements

- **All features must have tests**
- Run tests before pushing: `pnpm test`
- Test encryption thoroughly:
  - Encrypt/decrypt round-trip
  - Invalid key handling
  - Legacy (unencrypted) data compatibility
- Security tests for crypto operations

### 4. Code Quality

- **TypeScript strict mode**: No `any` types without justification
- Run type check: `npx tsc --noEmit`
- Keep code maintainable and readable
- Add comments for complex crypto operations
- Use meaningful variable names

### 5. Code Review & Refactoring

- Regular code reviews on PRs
- Refactor when code becomes complex
- Keep functions small and focused
- DRY principle but avoid premature abstraction

### 6. Documentation

- **Update CLAUDE.md** with every significant change
- Keep feature specifications current
- Document environment variables
- Add inline comments for complex logic

## Security Considerations

### Encryption

- Use Web Crypto API (native browser implementation)
- AES-128-GCM for authenticated encryption
- HKDF SHA-256 for key derivation
- Unique IV for each encryption operation

### Key Management

- Never log encryption keys
- Clear keys from memory when not needed
- Validate key format before use
- Handle decryption failures gracefully

### Password Handling

- Use PBKDF2 with high iteration count (100,000+)
- Salt passwords before hashing
- Never store plaintext passwords
- Rate limit password attempts
